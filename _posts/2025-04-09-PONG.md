A retro-style Pong clone written in C++ using SFML 3. This was a fun little exercise in game logic, SFML rendering, and building portable binaries for release.

## Overview

This project includes:

- Single-player (vs AI) and two-player modes  
- Win/loss conditions with sound and text feedback  
- Score tracking  
- Simple retro aesthetic using a pixel font and SFX

The game is built in C++17 using SFML and packaged using CMake and vcpkg.

## Build & Release

I wanted a single `.exe` I could distribute without needing external DLLs. For that I used MinGW with static linking:

```cmake
target_link_options(assignment_3_1 PRIVATE 
    -static 
    -static-libgcc 
    -static-libstdc++ 
    -Wl,--whole-archive -lpthread -Wl,--no-whole-archive
)
````

Once built in **Release** mode, I just zip up the `.exe` with the `Sound/` and `Text/` folders.

To make it work on Linux, I rebuilt it using `libsfml-dev` or vcpkg with `x64-linux`.

## Final Thoughts

Sometimes itâ€™s refreshing to build something self-contained and graphical. SFML is great for quick 2D games, and packaging static builds with CMake feels almost surgical when it works right.
