title: "About me:"
---

## Hello!

My name is **Jonathan Fedje**, and I’m studying Computer Engineering at the University of Agder. Alongside my studies, I work as a software engineer at [UiASub](https://uiasub.no), where I’m developing skills in programming, system design, and technical problem-solving.

I have previous experience from **IKT Agder** and **POWER Grimstad**, where I worked with communication, customer service, and technical support. These roles strengthened my ability to collaborate effectively and solve problems in a team environment.

Technology and innovation are my biggest passions. I love using technology to create practical solutions and gladly take on new challenges.

When I’m not coding or studying, I spend time on personal projects, explore new technologies, or participate in professional networks to exchange ideas and experiences.

You can find my projects and code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathand-cf).

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss technology or innovation!
