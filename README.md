## Test the build: 
1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rubyinstaller)
> In windows you must open ***Start command prompt with Ruby***

3. Install [Rubygems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems)
4. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) command in this cloned repo:
   ```bash
   bundle
   ```
5. Launch the website using
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
Which will make it available at http://localhost:4000,
where changes saved locally will take effect and you can tinker with the website.
