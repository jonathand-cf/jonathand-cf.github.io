2. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#rubyinstaller)

> In windows you must open ***Start command prompt with Ruby***

3. Install [Rubygems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems)
4. Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) command in this cloned repo:

   ```bash
   bundle
   ```

5. Launch the website using
